     * @ngdoc service
     * @kind function
     * @name $http
     * @requires ng.$httpBackend
     * @requires $cacheFactory
     * @requires $rootScope
     * @requires $q
     * @requires $injector

     * The `$http` service is a core Angular service that facilitates communication with the remote
     * HTTP servers via the browser's [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xmlhttprequest)
     * object or via [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP).
     *
     * For unit testing applications that use `$http` service, see
     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend $httpBackend mock}.
     *
     * For a higher level of abstraction, please check out the {@link ngResource.$resource
     * $resource} service.
     *
     * The $http API is based on the {@link ng.$q deferred/promise APIs} exposed by
     * the $q service. While for simple usage patterns this doesn't matter much, for advanced usage
     * it is important to familiarize yourself with these APIs and the guarantees they provide.
     *
     * # General usage
     * The `$http` service is a function which takes a single argument 〞 a configuration object 〞
     * that is used to generate an HTTP request and returns  a {@link ng.$q promise}
     * with two $http specific methods: `success` and `error`.
     *
     * ```js
     *   $http({method: 'GET', url: '/someUrl'}).
     *     success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
     *       // this callback will be called asynchronously
     *       // when the response is available
     *     }).
     *     error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
     *       // called asynchronously if an error occurs
     *       // or server returns response with an error status.
     *     });
     * ```
     * Since the returned value of calling the $http function is a `promise`, you can also use
     * the `then` method to register callbacks, and these callbacks will receive a single argument 每
     * an object representing the response. See the API signature and type info below for more
     * details.
     *
     * A response status code between 200 and 299 is considered a success status and
     * will result in the success callback being called. Note that if the response is a redirect,
     * XMLHttpRequest will transparently follow it, meaning that the error callback will not be
     * called for such responses.
     *
     * # Writing Unit Tests that use $http
     * When unit testing (using {@link ngMock ngMock}), it is necessary to call
     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend#flush $httpBackend.flush()} to flush each pending
     * request using trained responses.
     *
     * ```
     * $httpBackend.expectGET(...);
     * $http.get(...);
     * $httpBackend.flush();
     * ```
     * # Shortcut methods
     *
     * Shortcut methods are also available. All shortcut methods require passing in the URL, and
     * request data must be passed in for POST/PUT requests.
     *
     * ```js
     *   $http.get('/someUrl').success(successCallback);
     *   $http.post('/someUrl', data).success(successCallback);
     * ```
     *
     * Complete list of shortcut methods:
     *
     * - {@link ng.$http#get $http.get}
     * - {@link ng.$http#head $http.head}
     * - {@link ng.$http#post $http.post}
     * - {@link ng.$http#put $http.put}
     * - {@link ng.$http#delete $http.delete}
     * - {@link ng.$http#jsonp $http.jsonp}
     *
     *
     * # Setting HTTP Headers
     *
     * The $http service will automatically add certain HTTP headers to all requests. These defaults
     * can be fully configured by accessing the `$httpProvider.defaults.headers` configuration
     * object, which currently contains this default configuration:
     *
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.common` (headers that are common for all requests):
     *   - `Accept: application/json, text/plain, * / *`
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.post`: (header defaults for POST requests)
     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.put` (header defaults for PUT requests)
     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`
     *
     * To add or overwrite these defaults, simply add or remove a property from these configuration
     * objects. To add headers for an HTTP method other than POST or PUT, simply add a new object
     * with the lowercased HTTP method name as the key, e.g.
     * `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.get = { 'My-Header' : 'value' }.
     *
     * The defaults can also be set at runtime via the `$http.defaults` object in the same
     * fashion. For example:
     *
     * ```
     * module.run(function($http) {
     *   $http.defaults.headers.common.Authorization = 'Basic YmVlcDpib29w'
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * In addition, you can supply a `headers` property in the config object passed when
     * calling `$http(config)`, which overrides the defaults without changing them globally.
     *
     *
     * # Transforming Requests and Responses
     *
     * Both requests and responses can be transformed using transform functions. By default, Angular
     * applies these transformations:
     *
     * Request transformations:
     *
     * - If the `data` property of the request configuration object contains an object, serialize it
     *   into JSON format.
     *
     * Response transformations:
     *
     *  - If XSRF prefix is detected, strip it (see Security Considerations section below).
     *  - If JSON response is detected, deserialize it using a JSON parser.
     *
     * To globally augment or override the default transforms, modify the
     * `$httpProvider.defaults.transformRequest` and `$httpProvider.defaults.transformResponse`
     * properties. These properties are by default an array of transform functions, which allows you
     * to `push` or `unshift` a new transformation function into the transformation chain. You can
     * also decide to completely override any default transformations by assigning your
     * transformation functions to these properties directly without the array wrapper.  These defaults
     * are again available on the $http factory at run-time, which may be useful if you have run-time
     * services you wish to be involved in your transformations.
     *
     * Similarly, to locally override the request/response transforms, augment the
     * `transformRequest` and/or `transformResponse` properties of the configuration object passed
     * into `$http`.
     *
     *
     * # Caching
     *
     * To enable caching, set the request configuration `cache` property to `true` (to use default
     * cache) or to a custom cache object (built with {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}).
     * When the cache is enabled, `$http` stores the response from the server in the specified
     * cache. The next time the same request is made, the response is served from the cache without
     * sending a request to the server.
     *
     * Note that even if the response is served from cache, delivery of the data is asynchronous in
     * the same way that real requests are.
     *
     * If there are multiple GET requests for the same URL that should be cached using the same
     * cache, but the cache is not populated yet, only one request to the server will be made and
     * the remaining requests will be fulfilled using the response from the first request.
     *
     * You can change the default cache to a new object (built with
     * {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}) by updating the
     * {@link ng.$http#properties_defaults `$http.defaults.cache`} property. All requests who set
     * their `cache` property to `true` will now use this cache object.
     *
     * If you set the default cache to `false` then only requests that specify their own custom
     * cache object will be cached.
     *
     * # Interceptors
     *
     * Before you start creating interceptors, be sure to understand the
     * {@link ng.$q $q and deferred/promise APIs}.
     *
     * For purposes of global error handling, authentication, or any kind of synchronous or
     * asynchronous pre-processing of request or postprocessing of responses, it is desirable to be
     * able to intercept requests before they are handed to the server and
     * responses before they are handed over to the application code that
     * initiated these requests. The interceptors leverage the {@link ng.$q
     * promise APIs} to fulfill this need for both synchronous and asynchronous pre-processing.
     *
     * The interceptors are service factories that are registered with the `$httpProvider` by
     * adding them to the `$httpProvider.interceptors` array. The factory is called and
     * injected with dependencies (if specified) and returns the interceptor.
     *
     * There are two kinds of interceptors (and two kinds of rejection interceptors):
     *
     *   * `request`: interceptors get called with a http `config` object. The function is free to
     *     modify the `config` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `config`
     *     object directly, or a promise containing the `config` or a new `config` object.
     *   * `requestError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or
     *     resolved with a rejection.
     *   * `response`: interceptors get called with http `response` object. The function is free to
     *     modify the `response` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `response`
     *     object directly, or as a promise containing the `response` or a new `response` object.
     *   * `responseError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or
     *     resolved with a rejection.
     *
     *
     * ```js
     *   // register the interceptor as a service
     *   $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return {
     *       // optional method
     *       'request': function(config) {
     *         // do something on success
     *         return config;
     *       },
     *
     *       // optional method
     *      'requestError': function(rejection) {
     *         // do something on error
     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {
     *           return responseOrNewPromise
     *         }
     *         return $q.reject(rejection);
     *       },
     *
     *
     *
     *       // optional method
     *       'response': function(response) {
     *         // do something on success
     *         return response;
     *       },
     *
     *       // optional method
     *      'responseError': function(rejection) {
     *         // do something on error
     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {
     *           return responseOrNewPromise
     *         }
     *         return $q.reject(rejection);
     *       }
     *     };
     *   });
     *
     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');
     *
     *
     *   // alternatively, register the interceptor via an anonymous factory
     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push(function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return {
     *      'request': function(config) {
     *          // same as above
     *       },
     *
     *       'response': function(response) {
     *          // same as above
     *       }
     *     };
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     * # Response interceptors (DEPRECATED)
     *
     * Before you start creating interceptors, be sure to understand the
     * {@link ng.$q $q and deferred/promise APIs}.
     *
     * For purposes of global error handling, authentication or any kind of synchronous or
     * asynchronous preprocessing of received responses, it is desirable to be able to intercept
     * responses for http requests before they are handed over to the application code that
     * initiated these requests. The response interceptors leverage the {@link ng.$q
     * promise apis} to fulfil this need for both synchronous and asynchronous preprocessing.
     *
     * The interceptors are service factories that are registered with the $httpProvider by
     * adding them to the `$httpProvider.responseInterceptors` array. The factory is called and
     * injected with dependencies (if specified) and returns the interceptor  〞 a function that
     * takes a {@link ng.$q promise} and returns the original or a new promise.
     *
     * ```js
     *   // register the interceptor as a service
     *   $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return function(promise) {
     *       return promise.then(function(response) {
     *         // do something on success
     *         return response;
     *       }, function(response) {
     *         // do something on error
     *         if (canRecover(response)) {
     *           return responseOrNewPromise
     *         }
     *         return $q.reject(response);
     *       });
     *     }
     *   });
     *
     *   $httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');
     *
     *
     *   // register the interceptor via an anonymous factory
     *   $httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push(function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return function(promise) {
     *       // same as above
     *     }
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * # Security Considerations
     *
     * When designing web applications, consider security threats from:
     *
     * - [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)
     * - [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)
     *
     * Both server and the client must cooperate in order to eliminate these threats. Angular comes
     * pre-configured with strategies that address these issues, but for this to work backend server
     * cooperation is required.
     *
     * ## JSON Vulnerability Protection
     *
     * A [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)
     * allows third party website to turn your JSON resource URL into
     * [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) request under some conditions. To
     * counter this your server can prefix all JSON requests with following string `")]}',\n"`.
     * Angular will automatically strip the prefix before processing it as JSON.
     *
     * For example if your server needs to return:
     * ```js
     * ['one','two']
     * ```
     *
     * which is vulnerable to attack, your server can return:
     * ```js
     * )]}',
     * ['one','two']
     * ```
     *
     * Angular will strip the prefix, before processing the JSON.
     *
     *
     * ## Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) Protection
     *
     * [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) is a technique by which
     * an unauthorized site can gain your user's private data. Angular provides a mechanism
     * to counter XSRF. When performing XHR requests, the $http service reads a token from a cookie
     * (by default, `XSRF-TOKEN`) and sets it as an HTTP header (`X-XSRF-TOKEN`). Since only
     * JavaScript that runs on your domain could read the cookie, your server can be assured that
     * the XHR came from JavaScript running on your domain. The header will not be set for
     * cross-domain requests.
     *
     * To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session
     * cookie called `XSRF-TOKEN` on the first HTTP GET request. On subsequent XHR requests the
     * server can verify that the cookie matches `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header, and therefore be sure
     * that only JavaScript running on your domain could have sent the request. The token must be
     * unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server (to prevent the JavaScript from
     * making up its own tokens). We recommend that the token is a digest of your site's
     * authentication cookie with a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography))
     * for added security.
     *
     * The name of the headers can be specified using the xsrfHeaderName and xsrfCookieName
     * properties of either $httpProvider.defaults at config-time, $http.defaults at run-time,
     * or the per-request config object.
     *
     *
     * @param {object} config Object describing the request to be made and how it should be
     *    processed. The object has following properties:
     *
     *    - **method** 每 `{string}` 每 HTTP method (e.g. 'GET', 'POST', etc)
     *    - **url** 每 `{string}` 每 Absolute or relative URL of the resource that is being requested.
     *    - **params** 每 `{Object.<string|Object>}` 每 Map of strings or objects which will be turned
     *      to `?key1=value1&key2=value2` after the url. If the value is not a string, it will be
     *      JSONified.
     *    - **data** 每 `{string|Object}` 每 Data to be sent as the request message data.
     *    - **headers** 每 `{Object}` 每 Map of strings or functions which return strings representing
     *      HTTP headers to send to the server. If the return value of a function is null, the
     *      header will not be sent.
     *    - **xsrfHeaderName** 每 `{string}` 每 Name of HTTP header to populate with the XSRF token.
     *    - **xsrfCookieName** 每 `{string}` 每 Name of cookie containing the XSRF token.
     *    - **transformRequest** 每
     *      `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` 每
     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
     *      request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.
     *    - **transformResponse** 每
     *      `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` 每
     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
     *      response body and headers and returns its transformed (typically deserialized) version.
     *    - **cache** 每 `{boolean|Cache}` 每 If true, a default $http cache will be used to cache the
     *      GET request, otherwise if a cache instance built with
     *      {@link ng.$cacheFactory $cacheFactory}, this cache will be used for
     *      caching.
     *    - **timeout** 每 `{number|Promise}` 每 timeout in milliseconds, or {@link ng.$q promise}
     *      that should abort the request when resolved.
     *    - **withCredentials** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the
     *      XHR object. See [requests with credentials]https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control#section_5
     *      for more information.
     *    - **responseType** - `{string}` - see
     *      [requestType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#responseType).
     *
     * @returns {HttpPromise} Returns a {@link ng.$q promise} object with the
     *   standard `then` method and two http specific methods: `success` and `error`. The `then`
     *   method takes two arguments a success and an error callback which will be called with a
     *   response object. The `success` and `error` methods take a single argument - a function that
     *   will be called when the request succeeds or fails respectively. The arguments passed into
     *   these functions are destructured representation of the response object passed into the
     *   `then` method. The response object has these properties:
     *
     *   - **data** 每 `{string|Object}` 每 The response body transformed with the transform
     *     functions.
     *   - **status** 每 `{number}` 每 HTTP status code of the response.
     *   - **headers** 每 `{function([headerName])}` 每 Header getter function.
     *   - **config** 每 `{Object}` 每 The configuration object that was used to generate the request.
     *   - **statusText** 每 `{string}` 每 HTTP status text of the response.
     *
     * @property {Array.<Object>} pendingRequests Array of config objects for currently pending
     *   requests. This is primarily meant to be used for debugging purposes.
